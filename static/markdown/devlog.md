### **🔹 Recap: What We Have Done So Far** 🔹  
We have made significant progress in **transforming your static gallery into a FastAPI-powered application** with improved functionality and content management. Here's a summary of what we have accomplished:  

---

## **1️⃣ FastAPI Web App Setup**
✅ Converted your **static website** into a **FastAPI** web application.  
✅ Hosted the site on your **VPS**, ensuring it serves pages correctly.  
✅ Implemented **Markdown-based content management** for pages like **About Me, Blog, and Contacts**.  

---

## **2️⃣ Improved UI & Styling**
✅ **Reorganized header & footer** for a consistent look.  
✅ Added a **style switcher (dropdown in the footer)** to let users **change themes dynamically**.  
✅ **Locked the header to the top** to ensure smooth navigation.  
✅ Applied **custom fonts** (Pinkend for titles, Verdana for regular text).  
✅ **Thumbnails now align correctly** and display properly.

---

## **3️⃣ JSON Data Management & Gallery Loading**
✅ **Fixed `data.json` loading issues** to ensure gallery updates properly.  
✅ Implemented **automatic gallery refresh** when new JSON data is generated.  
✅ Prevented **browser caching issues** by appending `?v=${new Date().getTime()}` when fetching JSON.  
✅ Updated **image paths** to use `/static/images/` instead of outdated paths.  

---

## **4️⃣ Thumbnails & Image Handling**
✅ Created a **thumbnail generation script (`Create Thumbnails.py`)** that:  
   - Scans `/static/images/` for full-size images.  
   - Cleans the `/static/images/thumbnails/` folder before regenerating thumbnails.  
   - Saves resized thumbnails in `/static/images/thumbnails/`.  
✅ Updated **JavaScript to ensure thumbnails are correctly displayed** and link to full-size images.

---

## **5️⃣ Modal for Viewing Full-Size Images**
✅ Implemented a **modal (popup) system** that:  
   - Opens when a **thumbnail is clicked**.  
   - Displays the **full-size image** from `/static/images/`.  
   - Closes when clicking **outside the image** or on the **close button (X)**.  
✅ Ensured **gallery images always load from `/static/images/`**, preventing broken links.  

---

## **6️⃣ JSON Regeneration & Admin Page**
✅ Created an **Admin section** where you can:  
   - Click a button to **regenerate `data.json`**.  
   - Automatically refresh the gallery when JSON updates.  
✅ Fixed **FastAPI route to regenerate JSON**, making sure it saves inside `/static/`.

---

## **7️⃣ Image Analysis & Metadata Generation**
✅ **Analyzed uploaded artworks** and generated:  
   - **Unique titles in Italian** for each artwork.  
   - **Creative descriptions** to add personality to your gallery.  
✅ Updated **`gallery_json_template.xlsx`** with these new titles and descriptions.
